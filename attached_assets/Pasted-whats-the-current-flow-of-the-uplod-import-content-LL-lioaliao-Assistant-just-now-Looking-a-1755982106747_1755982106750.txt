Looking at your codebase, here's the current flow of the upload/import content process:

Current Content Import Flow
1. Frontend UI (ContentImport.tsx)
Content Type Selection: User selects from 5 content types (Reel, Podcast, Image, Post, Event)
Two Import Methods:
File Upload: Drag & drop or browse files
URL Import: Import from YouTube, TikTok, Spotify URLs
2. File Upload Flow
User drops/selects files → handleFileUpload() → Simulated upload progress → Status: 'ready'
Files are processed locally with simulated progress
Each file gets assigned a random ID and IPFS CID (simulated)
Status progresses: uploading → ready
3. URL Import Flow
User enters URL → handleUrlImport() → Simulated import → Status: 'ready'
Similar to file upload but for external URLs
Creates metadata with original URL reference
4. Backend API Endpoints
POST /api/content-imports/upload: Handles actual file uploads to IPFS
POST /api/content-imports/import-url: Handles URL imports
POST /api/content-imports/:id/tokenize: Starts tokenization process
GET /api/content-imports: Retrieves content by channel
5. IPFS Integration
Files are uploaded to IPFS via uploadFileToIPFS()
Metadata is stored as JSON on IPFS via uploadJSONToIPFS()
Both media CID and metadata CID are stored
6. Database Storage
Content records stored in content_imports table
Includes: title, description, content type, IPFS CIDs, status, metadata
Linked to channels via channelId
7. Tokenization Flow
User clicks "Tokenize" → Status: 'tokenizing' → Simulated delay → Status: 'tokenized'
Currently simulated with 3-second delay
Updates database with tokenization timestamp
Current Status
The frontend shows a simulation of the upload process, but the actual backend endpoints exist and can handle real file uploads to IPFS. The frontend needs to be connected to call the actual API endpoints instead of using the simulated progress.

Would you like me to connect the frontend to the actual backend endpoints to make the upload/import process functional?
