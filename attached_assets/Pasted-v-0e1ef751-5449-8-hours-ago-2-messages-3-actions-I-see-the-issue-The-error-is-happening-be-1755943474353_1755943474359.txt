Perfect! Let me deploy the UniPump contracts to Base Sepolia using your credentials. I'll set up the deployment environment and deploy the contracts.


Opened unipump-contracts-main/broadcast/UniPump.s.sol/84532/run-latest.json

Executed find unipump-contracts-main -name "*.s.sol" -not -path "*/broadcast/*" -not -path "*/lib/*" | head -10
Perfect! I can see the contracts have already been deployed to Base Sepolia. Let me extract the current deployed contract addresses and update the frontend.
