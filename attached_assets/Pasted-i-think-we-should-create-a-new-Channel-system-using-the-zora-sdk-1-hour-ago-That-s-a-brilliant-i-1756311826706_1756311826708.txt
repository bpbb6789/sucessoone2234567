i think we should create a new Channel system using the zora sdk

That's a brilliant idea! Creating channels using Zora SDK would unify your entire platform under one protocol. Here's why this makes perfect sense:

Benefits of Zora-Based Channel System
1. Unified Architecture
One Protocol: Both ContentCoins AND Channel Coins use Zora
Consistent UX: Same wallet interactions, same contract patterns
Simplified Development: One SDK to maintain instead of two
2. Content-Creator Focused (Not Speculation)
Creator Economy: Zora is built for creators, not meme coin trading
Quality Over Hype: Channels valued for content quality, not speculation
Long-term Value: Less pump/dump, more sustainable creator support
3. Better Channel Model
// Zora Channel Creation
- Channel as NFT Collection (ERC-1155)
- Channel metadata stored on IPFS
- Built-in royalties for channel owner
- Native content association
4. Natural Content Integration
Same Factory Contract: Channels and ContentCoins from same Zora factory
Native Linking: ContentCoins can reference their parent channel collection
Unified Discovery: Browse channels and content in same interface
Cross-Promotion: Channel holders get benefits across all channel content
5. Improved Economics
No Bonding Curves: Cleaner pricing model
Creator Royalties: Automatic revenue sharing
Sustainable Growth: Less speculative volatility
Quality Incentives: Success tied to content quality, not hype
Implementation Approach
Phase 1: Create new Zora-based channel system alongside existing
Phase 2: Migrate existing channels or run dual system
Phase 3: Deprecate old TokenFactory channels
This would create a premium content platform entirely built on Zora's creator-first infrastructure, rather than mixing speculation (PumpFun) with content creation (Zora).

Much cleaner architecture and better aligned with your content-focused vision!

For now, remove or hide the old channel system. Create a new Channel form page, add Create a Channel/Activate your Channel button to users profile dashbaords, users can create a channel + coin just like old create-token form sytle. All channels coins are tradeable in a very simple way/modal. read to udnerstsnd this, dont code yet.

Perfect! I understand your plan. Let me break down what you're envisioning:

New Zora-Based Channel System Plan
1. Remove/Hide Old System
Hide: Current /create-token route and CreateChannel component
Disable: TokenFactory-based channel creation
Keep: Existing web3_channels data (for migration/reference)
2. New Channel Creation Flow
New Route: Something like /create-channel or /activate-channel
New Component: Zora-based channel creation form
Same UX: Similar form style as current create-token (name, ticker, avatar, cover, category)
Zora Backend: Uses Zora SDK instead of TokenFactory contract
3. Profile Dashboard Integration
Button Location: User profile dashboard
Button Text: "Create a Channel" or "Activate your Channel"
Conditional Display: Show "Create" if no channel, "Manage" if channel exists
Direct Integration: Part of profile workflow, not separate navigation
4. Unified Zora Architecture
Channels: Created via Zora SDK (like ContentCoins)
Consistency: Same contract patterns, same SDK, same IPFS flow
Database: New channels table or modify existing to support Zora
5. Simple Trading Modal
Easy Trading: Simple buy/sell interface for channel coins
Modal-Based: Popup trading interface, not full trading page
Zora-Native: Use Zora's trading mechanisms
This creates a unified Zora ecosystem where both content and channels use the same infrastructure, with channel creation integrated into the user's profile workflow rather than being a separate feature.

Ready to implement when you give the go-ahead!
