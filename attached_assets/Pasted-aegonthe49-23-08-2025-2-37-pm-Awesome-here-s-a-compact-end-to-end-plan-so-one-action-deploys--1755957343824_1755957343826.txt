Awesome—here’s a compact, end-to-end plan so one action = deploys the coin (on-chain) + creates the channel (off-chain), and the Channel Manager appears on the profile right after.

What the user sees (copy & UX)

Create Channel (this is the form title—even though it deploys a coin under the hood)

Required
 • Channel name → “This will also be your on-chain token name.”
 • Ticker (3–8 chars) → “Your on-chain token symbol, e.g. @alex → ALEX.”
 • Category (Reels, Podcasts, Events, Art, Music…)
 • Cover media (image/video poster) + Avatar (image)

Advanced (accordion)
 • Payout address (defaults to connected wallet)
 • Chain (Base / Base Sepolia)
 • Trading engine (Zora default; Doppler later toggle)
 • Royalties / splits (optional)

CTA: Create Channel
Subtext: “This will deploy your Channel Coin on-chain and create your channel.”

Progress steps (inline, no page change)
 1. Uploading media to IPFS
 2. Preparing metadata
 3. Deploying Channel Coin (wallet pop-up)
 4. Confirming transaction
 5. Creating channel…

On success: toast + “Open Channel Manager” button (and it appears on the profile sidebar).

⸻

Field → parameter mapping
 • Channel name → token.name
 • Ticker → token.symbol
 • Cover/Avatar + metadata JSON → token.uri (ipfs://…)
 • Payout address → payoutRecipient
 • Chain → chainId

⸻

Sequence (clean & reliable)

Front-end (user wallet signs tx)
 1. Upload avatar/cover → IPFS (Pinata).
 2. Build metadata JSON → IPFS (Pinata) → get ipfs://CID.
 3. Call Zora Coins SDK createCoin({ name, symbol, uri, payoutRecipient, ... }).
 4. Wait for receipt → get coinAddress, txHash.
 5. POST to backend /api/channels with:

{
  "coinAddress": "0x…",
  "chainId": 8453,
  "name": "Channel name",
  "ticker": "TICK",
  "avatarCid": "Qm…",
  "coverCid": "Qm…",
  "category": "Reels",
  "txHash": "0x…"
}


 6. Redirect to /channel/[slug]/manager.

Backend (trust but verify)
 • Verify txHash & coinAddress on chainId:
 • getTransactionReceipt(txHash) success & to = factory (if you track it) OR
 • getCode(coinAddress) returns bytecode (non-empty).
 • Enforce one channel per owner (or allow many—your call).
 • Insert channel + link to user.

⸻

Minimal data model (Prisma-style, compact)

model Channel {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  owner         String   // wallet address (checksum normalized)
  name          String
  slug          String   @unique
  ticker        String   @unique
  coinAddress   String   @unique
  chainId       Int
  avatarCid     String?
  coverCid      String?
  category      String   // 'Reels' | 'Podcasts' | 'Events' | ...
  status        String   @default("active")
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt

  @@unique([owner]) // if you want 1 channel per user; remove if multi-channel
}


⸻

API (thin & explicit)

POST /api/channels
 • Auth: connected wallet must match msg.sender that deployed the coin (verify via receipt from).
 • Body: as above.
 • Side effects:
 • Create row in Channel.
 • Create default permissions: owner = admin/poster.
 • Emit app event channel.created.

GET /api/me (profile sidebar)
 • If Channel exists for owner, return { hasChannel: true, managerPath: "/channel/[slug]/manager" }.
 • UI shows Channel Manager button when hasChannel.

⸻

Guardrails & validation
 • Ticker: A–Z, 3–8 chars, unique.
 • Name: 3–32 chars, unique slug.
 • Reject if tx not mined or address has no code.
 • Idempotent create: if a channel already exists for owner, return it (don’t duplicate).
 • Rollback on failures (e.g., if coin deploy fails, never create channel).

⸻

Channel Manager (what appears after)

Tabs (compact):
 • Overview (price, holders, market cap, top reels)
 • Reels (upload/manage, status)
 • Community (members/roles)
 • Earnings (creator cut, withdrawals)
 • Settings (name/avatar/cover; cannot change ticker/symbol)

Button appears on profile as soon as backend confirms /api/channels and returns the manager path.

⸻

Why this matches your requirement
 • Labels are “Channel” everywhere (no token jargon).

aegonthe49, [23/08/2025 2:37 pm]
• One click performs both: on-chain coin + off-chain channel.
 • Channel Manager visibility is data-driven (channel exists in DB).
 • On explorers, the token name/symbol match the channel name/ticker, keeping terminology consistent.

If you want, I can supply a compact React form + API handler that follows this exact flow.
