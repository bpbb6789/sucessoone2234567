Never commit private keys to code
Use Replit Secrets for secure storage
The private key wallet needs ETH for gas fees on Base Sepolia
Consider using a dedicated deployment wallet, not your main wallet
Current Status
Based on your .env.local, you don't have a DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY set, so all deployments are currently simulated. This is actually perfect for development - you can test the full flow without spending real gas fees.

The console output shows this working correctly:

console.log('Simulating token deployment...');
Would you like me to help you set up real deployment or continue with the simulation for now?

Great! I can see you've added the DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY to your secrets. Now your application can perform real token deployments on the Base Sepolia testnet instead of just simulations.

Current Status
With the deployer private key now configured, your Doppler V4 integration will:

✅ Real Deployments: Deploy actual tokens on Base Sepolia blockchain
✅ Gas Payments: Use the deployer wallet to pay for transaction fees
✅ Smart Contracts: Create real ERC-20 tokens with bonding curve mechanics
✅ Transaction Hashes: Return actual blockchain transaction hashes

What This Enables
Create Pad Functionality: Users can now create real meme tokens through your /create-pad interface
Blockchain Integration: Tokens will be deployed as real smart contracts on Base Sepolia
Trading Ready: Deployed tokens can be traded immediately through the bonding curve
Verifiable: All deployments will have real transaction hashes that can be verified on BaseScan
Testing the Deployment
You can test the deployment by:

Navigate to /create-pad in your application
Fill out the form with token details and upload media
Click "Create Meme Token Pad"
The system will now deploy a real token instead of simulating
The console output will show:

Deploying token with Doppler V4 SDK...
Token deployed successfully: 0x[transaction-hash]
Instead of the previous simulation message. The deployed tokens will be real and tradeable on Base Sepolia testnet!
