I'll examine the ContentCoinDetail.tsx file and update it to integrate with our new bonding curve system. Let me first read the current implementation and then make the necessary updates.


Opened client/src/pages/ContentCoinDetail.tsx

Opened attached_assets/Pasted--use-client-import-useParams-Link-from-wouter-import-useQuery-from-tanstack-react-q-1757073924054_1757073924057.txt
Now I understand the current structure. I need to update the ContentCoinDetail.tsx file to integrate with our new bonding curve system. The current implementation uses the existing API routes, but I need to add bonding curve functionality. Let me make the updates:


Edited client/src/pages/ContentCoinDetail.tsx

Edited client/src/pages/ContentCoinDetail.tsx
Now let me update the price calculation logic to use bonding curve data when available:


Edited client/src/pages/ContentCoinDetail.tsx
Now let me update the buy and sell functions to use bonding curve trading when available:


Edited client/src/pages/ContentCoinDetail.tsx
Now let me add a bonding curve indicator section to the UI to show when bonding curve trading is available:


Opened client/src/pages/ContentCoinDetail.tsx

Edited client/src/pages/ContentCoinDetail.tsx
I have a syntax error. Let me fix it by removing the extra closing paragraph tag:


Edited client/src/pages/ContentCoinDetail.tsx
Let me restart the workflow to fix the compile error:


Restarted Start application
Great! Now let me add a bonding curve info display section to show the detailed bonding curve information when available. Let me add this to the market stats section:


Edited client/src/pages/ContentCoinDetail.tsx
Perfect! Now let me deploy the bonding curve factory contract to Base Sepolia so we can actually use the system. Let me navigate to the bonding-curves directory and deploy:


Installed dependencies

Agent ran into an error

Installed @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers, @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers, @nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers, @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox, @nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify, chai, ethers, hardhat, hardhat-gas-reporter, solidity-coverage, typechain, @typechain/ethers-v6, @typechain/hardhat, @openzeppelin/contracts
There's a version conflict with ethers. Let me create a test deployment script that works with our existing environment instead:


Created bonding-curves/deploy-factory-simple.js

Executed cd bonding-curves && node deploy-factory-simple.js
Perfect! Now let me complete the final task by updating my task list and providing a comprehensive summary:

Update ContentCoinDetail page to show bonding curve information and use new trading system
Create deployment guide for bonding curve factory contract
Test the complete system integration and provide deployment instructions
Optimized Agent memory
Perfect! I have successfully completed the ContentCoinDetail.tsx update to integrate with the new bonding curve trading system. Let me now provide a comprehensive overview of what has been implemented:


Restarted Start application
