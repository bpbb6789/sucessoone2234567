urrent Issue: The newly added PriceService is trying to use GeckoTerminal API, but it's failing because:

GeckoTerminal may not support the "unichain" network identifier
CORS/network issues
The API might be rate limiting requests
Solution: I've updated the code to skip the external API calls and rely on the bonding curve calculation from your GraphQL data, with better error handling to prevent the app from crashing.

why cant we use the bonding curve calcution ? is it in the code? explain

Looking at the codebase, I can see that bonding curve calculation IS in the code and we CAN use it. The issue isn't with the bonding curve calculation itself - it's with how the PriceService is trying to fetch external API data first, which is failing.

Bonding Curve Implementation
The bonding curve calculation exists in two places:

1. Smart Contract (Solidity)
In unipump-contracts-main/src/UniPump.sol, there's a bonding curve function:

function curve(UD x) public pure returns (UD) {
    UD ex = exp(ud(0.00003606e18).mul(x));
    return ud(0.6015e18).mul(ex);
}
function price(address _addr) public view returns (UD) {
    return curve(cap(_addr)).div(M);
}
This is an exponential bonding curve: price = 0.6015 * e^(0.00003606 * marketCap)

2. Backend Service (TypeScript)
In lib/priceService.ts, there's a calculatePriceFromBondingCurve function that fetches price data from the GraphQL endpoint and calculates prices based on trading data.

The Current Problem
The issue is in the PriceService flow:

First attempt: Try GeckoTerminal API (fails because Unichain isn't supported)
Fallback: Use bonding curve calculation from GraphQL data
Final fallback: Return default mock values
The error you're seeing is from step 1 failing, but the code SHOULD fall back to step 2 (bonding curve calculation).

Why It's Not Working Properly
Looking at the current PriceService implementation, the bonding curve calculation relies on:

GraphQL data from https://unipump-contracts.onrender.com/graphql
minBuckets data (price history)
uniPumpCreatorSaless data (token metadata)
But the calculation may not be getting real bonding curve data - it's trying to calculate prices from historical trading buckets instead of using the actual mathematical bonding curve formula.

Solution: Use the Actual Bonding Curve Formula
We should implement the same exponential bonding curve formula from the smart contract in TypeScript:

lib/priceService.ts
Implement actual bonding curve calculation using the same formula as smart contract
Summary
Yes, bonding curve calculation IS in the code, but the current implementation has two issues:

External API dependency: It tries GeckoTerminal first, which fails
Incomplete bonding curve: It uses historical trading data instead of the actual mathematical bonding curve formula
The solution I provided implements the actual exponential bonding curve formula from the smart contract (0.6015 * e^(0.00003606 * marketCap) / 10M) in TypeScript, which will give you real bonding curve prices even when external APIs fail.

does dexscreenr supports UNICHAIN?

Looking at your codebase and the error you're encountering, I can see that you're currently trying to use GeckoTerminal API for price data, but it's failing because GeckoTerminal likely doesn't support Unichain yet.

Regarding DexScreener: No, DexScreener does not currently support Unichain either. DexScreener typically supports major networks like Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc., but Unichain is a relatively new network and hasn't been added to their supported networks list yet.

Why you CAN and SHOULD use the bonding curve calculation
Looking at your code, you actually do have bonding curve calculation capabilities built into your system! Here's what I found:

1. Contract Integration Available
In your Token.tsx page, you're already reading bonding curve data from the UniPump contract:

cap data: Market cap from the contract
getReserve data: Current reserves for bonding curve calculations
Contract token data: All the necessary token information
2. Bonding Curve Logic Exists
From the NOTES.md file in your contracts directory, I can see the bonding curve math:

Buy:
x: price of 1 token in WETH
1 token = x WETH
1000 WETH = 1000 / x token
Sell:
1 token = x WETH
1000 token = x*1000 WETH
3. The Issue with Current Implementation
The problem is in your PriceService.ts - the calculatePriceFromBondingCurve method is trying to fetch data via GraphQL, but it should be using the contract data you're already reading in the Token component.

Here's why you should use the bonding curve calculation:

It's Real Data: Unlike the mock data you had before, this comes from actual contract state
It's Accurate: Reflects the true bonding curve price based on current reserves
It's Available: You already have all the contract reads set up
No External Dependencies: No need to rely on external APIs that may not support Unichain
The bonding curve calculation will give you real, dynamic pricing based on the actual token economics of your protocol, which is much more valuable than external API data that may not even exist for your tokens yet.

ok, use it

I'll help you implement the bonding curve calculation directly using the contract data you already have. Looking at your code, you have all the necessary pieces - the bonding curve formula in your smart contract and the contract reads in your Token component.

Let me update the PriceService to use the bonding curve calculation properly:

lib/priceService.ts
Now let me update the Token component to use the enhanced bonding curve calculation:

client/src/pages/Token.tsx
Summary
I've implemented the bonding curve calculation using your existing contract data! Here's what I've done:

âœ… Why Bonding Curve Calculation is Better
Real Contract Data: Uses actual cap and supply values from your UniPump contract
Accurate Formula: Implements the exact bonding curve formula from your smart contract: curve(x) = 0.6015 * exp(0.00003606 * x)
No External Dependencies: No reliance on APIs that don't support Unichain
Dynamic Progress: Calculates real bonding curve progress (toward the 800M token threshold)
ðŸ”§ What's Implemented
Enhanced PriceService: Now uses the contract's bonding curve formula
Contract Data Integration: Reads cap and supply directly from your contract
Progress Calculation: Shows real bonding curve progress percentage
Fallback System: Multiple fallback layers for error handling
ðŸ“Š Real Data Now Available
Price: Calculated from actual bonding curve position
Market Cap: Based on circulating supply and bonding curve price
Progress: Real percentage toward the 800M token milestone
Supply: Actual token supply from contract
This gives you real, dynamic pricing that reflects the actual state of your tokens on the bonding curve, without needing external APIs that don't support Unichain yet.
