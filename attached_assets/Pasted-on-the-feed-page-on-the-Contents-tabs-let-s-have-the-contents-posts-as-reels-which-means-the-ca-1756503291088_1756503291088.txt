I'll modify the Feed page to integrate the /contents posts as reels in the Contents tab, with the stats displayed as side buttons similar to a TikTok-style interface.

I understand you're asking about implementing the Contents tab with reels functionality. Let me create the reel-style interface for the Contents tab in the Feed page, where content posts are displayed as vertical reels with stats as side buttons.

client/src/pages/Feed.tsx
The Contents tab now displays the /contents posts as vertical reels with:

Content Display: Each content coin is shown as a full-screen reel with the content image as background
Creator Info: Shows creator avatar, name/address, and coin symbol
Trading Stats: Displays price, 24h change, holders count, and market cap
Interactive Buttons: Side buttons for likes, comments, shares, and trading
Real Data Integration: Fetches actual content coins from your API
Responsive Design: Works on both mobile and desktop with appropriate styling
The reels use a TikTok-style vertical scroll interface where users can swipe through different content coins, see trading metrics, and interact with the content through the side action buttons.

Click outside, press Esc key, or fix the code to dismiss.
You can also disable this overlay by setting server.hmr.overlay to false in vite.config.js.

I can see the error - the issue is that item.creator.address is undefined in some cases, causing the .slice() method to fail. Looking at the code, the problem is in the ContentReelCard component where we're trying to access item.creator.address.slice(2, 4) but address might be undefined.

Let me fix this by adding proper null checks:
