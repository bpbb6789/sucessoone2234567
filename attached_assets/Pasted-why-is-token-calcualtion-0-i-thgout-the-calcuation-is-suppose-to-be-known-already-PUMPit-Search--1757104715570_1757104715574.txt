Ah — I see what’s happening 👀. Right now your UI says:

Amount (ETH): 0.00006  
You'll receive: ≈ 0 DINOBO


and everything else is “No data.” That means the bonding curve math isn’t being read yet from your exchange contract, so the frontend defaults to 0.

🔹 Why This Happens

First trade hasn’t happened yet

Until someone buys, the curve hasn’t minted any supply.

Price = undefined → your UI just shows 0 or “No data.”

Frontend not calling the curve formula

In Pump.fun–style bonding curves, tokens received are not fixed.

They’re calculated dynamically by the contract:

tokensOut = f(ETHIn, supply, reserve)

If your frontend isn’t calling getAmountOut() (or your curve’s buy function), you’ll just see 0.

Decimals / formatting bug

ERC20 tokens often use 18 decimals.

If your code divides incorrectly, 0.00006 ETH might look like “≈ 0 tokens” even though it’s e.g. 1200 DINOBO.

🔹 What Should Happen

When you type 0.00006 ETH, the bonding curve contract should calculate:

How many DINOBO tokens that ETH amount buys,

Update price, market cap, supply, and reserve.

Even with no prior buyers, the bonding curve usually starts at a known initial price (set in your factory/exchange contract).

🔹 Fix Path

Check your contract functions

Do you have a public view like getCurrentPrice() or quoteBuy(amountETH)?

The frontend must call that before showing ≈ tokens.

Hook up UI correctly

On ETH input → call contract’s buy quote method.

Show the returned token amount.

Test on Base Sepolia

Manually call buy(0.00006 ETH) from your wallet.

See how many tokens the tx gives back.

That’s the real bonding curve math.

⚡ Question: do you want me to draft the exact viem snippet so that when a user types ETH in the Buy box, the UI calls the curve contract and shows how many tokens they’ll receive (instead of 0)?
