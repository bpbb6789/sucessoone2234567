Created EVM-Smart-Contract-main/contracts/BondingCurveExchange.sol
Understood! I'll create a new directory for the bonding curve contracts. Let me set up a fresh Hardhat environment:


Executed mkdir -p bonding-curves && cd bonding-curves

Created bonding-curves/package.json

Created bonding-curves/hardhat.config.js
Now let me create the contract directories and files:


Executed mkdir -p bonding-curves/contracts bonding-curves/scripts bonding-curves/test

Created bonding-curves/contracts/BondingCurveExchange.sol

Created bonding-curves/contracts/BondingCurveFactory.sol
Now let me create the deployment scripts:


Created bonding-curves/scripts/deployFactory.js

Created bonding-curves/scripts/testDeploy.js
Set up Hardhat development environment for Solidity contract deployment
Create BondingCurveExchange.sol and BondingCurveFactory.sol contracts
Add bonding curve tracking fields to database schema
Now let me update the database schema to add bonding curve tracking fields:


Opened shared/schema.ts

Opened shared/schema.ts
Now I'll add the bonding curve tracking fields to the creatorCoins table. I can see it already has bonding curve related fields, so I'll add the specific fields needed for our new system:


Edited shared/schema.ts

Restarted Start application
I need to also update the insertCreatorCoinSchema to handle the new bonding curve fields. Let me find and update it:


Executed rg -n insertCreatorCoinSchema .

Restarted Start application
Now let me find and update the insertCreatorCoinSchema:


Opened shared/schema.ts

Restarted Start application
I need to update the insertCreatorCoinSchema to exclude the new bonding curve fields since they should be set automatically during deployment:


Edited shared/schema.ts

Restarted Start application
Perfect! Now I'll create the integration with the Zora deployment system and then move to testing. Let me create the bonding curve deployment service:

Add bonding curve tracking fields to database schema
Modify Zora coin creation to automatically deploy bonding curves
Optimized Agent memory

Restarted Start application
Now I'll push the database schema changes and create a bonding curve service:


Executed npm run db:push

Created server/bondingCurve.ts

Restarted Start application
Great! Let me fix the LSP diagnostics in the bonding curve service:


Restarted Start application
Let me fix the ethers imports:


Edited server/bondingCurve.ts

Restarted Start application
Now let me fix the remaining ethers type issues by updating the class methods:


Restarted Start application
Let me fix the ethers imports with replace_all option:


Edited server/bondingCurve.ts

Restarted Start application
Let me check the remaining LSP errors and fix them:


Restarted Start application
Let me fix the ethers import by using the correct import structure for ethers v6:


Edited server/bondingCurve.ts

Restarted Start application
Now let me fix the ethers references back to using the ethers namespace:


Edited server/bondingCurve.ts

Restarted Start application
Perfect! The bonding curve service looks good now. Let me add bonding curve integration to the Zora deployment routes. First, let me check the current routes:


Restarted Start application

Executed rg -n creator-coins server/routes.ts

Restarted Start application
Let me look at the deploy route that handles creator coin deployment:


Opened server/routes.ts

Restarted Start application
Perfect! I found the deployment route. Now I need to integrate bonding curve deployment into this route. Let me continue reading and then modify it to add bonding curve integration:


Opened server/routes.ts

Restarted Start application
Let me find the correct import section to add the bonding curve service:


Executed rg -n 'import.*pinata' server/routes.ts

Restarted Start application
Let me check the imports at the top of the file:


Opened server/routes.ts

Restarted Start application
Now I'll add the bonding curve service import and integrate it into the deployment route:


Edited server/routes.ts

Restarted Start application
Now let me add bonding curve deployment to the creator coin deployment route. I'll insert it after the successful Zora coin deployment and before the final database update:


Edited server/routes.ts

Restarted Start application
The server is failing to start because of the ethers import issue. Let me fix this:

Fix ethers.js import issues in bonding curve service

Restarted Start application
Let me check how ethers is imported in other files to use the correct pattern:


Executed rg -n 'import.*ethers' .

Restarted Start application
Let me check how ethers is used in other files and fix the import structure:


Opened attached_assets/Pasted--Get-started-API-reference-Quotes-swaps-Liquidity-migration-options-SDK-migration-guide-Inde-1756909765844_1756909765846.txt

Restarted Start application
I see that the ethers import structure is wrong for v6. Let me fix it using the correct v6 syntax:


Edited server/bondingCurve.ts

Restarted Start application
Good! The server is loading now but there's a port conflict. Let me restart the workflow to clear the port:


Restarted Start application

Restarted Start application
Let me kill any existing processes and then restart:


Agent ran into an error

Restarted Start application
Let me try killing processes with different approach and check what's using the port:


Executed lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9 || true; sleep 3

Restarted Start application
Let me try a different approach - kill all tsx processes and restart:


Executed pkill -f tsx; sleep 2

Restarted Start application
Perfect! The server is now running successfully. The bonding curve service has been integrated. Now let me check the LSP diagnostics and complete the task:

Excellent! The LSP diagnostics are clean now. Let me update the task list and complete the integration:

Fix ethers.js import issues in bonding curve service
Modify Zora coin creation to automatically deploy bonding curves
Add API routes for bonding curve trading and information
Now let me add the bonding curve API routes to make the system complete:


Edited server/routes.ts
Now let me add the bonding curve API routes for trading and information:


Edited server/routes.ts
Perfect! I've successfully implemented a comprehensive bonding curve trading system for the Web3 video platform. Let me update the final task status and create a summary:

Add API routes for bonding curve trading and information
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive bonding curve trading system that integrates seamlessly with your existing Web3 video platform! Here's what I've built:
