Looking at the console logs you've shared, this appears to be a mock deployment, not a real blockchain deployment. Here are the key indicators:

Evidence it's Mock:
Mock Token Address: The token address 0x000000000000000000000000000001991fb93719 is clearly a mock address - it has many zeros and ends with a timestamp-like pattern.

Mock Transaction Hash: The transaction hash 0xc9f115eb718fd is too short for a real Ethereum transaction hash (should be 66 characters long).

Code Analysis: Looking at your contentTokenRoutes.ts, the deployment is creating mock data:

// For now, create a mock token address
// In production, you would deploy the actual bonding curve contract
const tokenAddress = `0x${Date.now().toString(16).padStart(40, '0')}`;
const deployResult = {
  success: true,
  contractAddress: tokenAddress,
  transactionHash: `0x${Math.random().toString(16).substring(2)}`
};
What's Actually Happening:
✅ File Upload: Your file is successfully uploaded to IPFS via Pinata (real)
✅ IPFS Storage: The content gets a real IPFS CID: bafkreifg6e2gqm4oizm64g7nu2sgl2pevmtkqadkjk26qos7khsmkkgepe
❌ Blockchain Deploy: The token deployment is mocked - no real smart contract is deployed
To Enable Real Deployment:
You need to complete the bonding curve contract deployment. Based on your codebase, you have the contracts ready in the bonding-curves folder, but they need to be deployed to Base Sepolia. The current implementation is intentionally using mock data while the real blockchain integration is being developed.

The IPFS upload is working perfectly - your content is actually stored on IPFS. Only the token contract deployment part is mocked.

why? since the contract is deployed?

Looking at the console logs, I can see the issue. The error pinata.upload.buffer is not a function is still occurring, which means there's a discrepancy between what we fixed and what's actually being used in your code.

The problem is that there are two different database issues happening:

Database Connection Issue: Your Neon database endpoint has been disabled, which is why you're seeing all those NeonDbError: The endpoint has been disabled messages.

IPFS Upload Issue: The error shows pinata.upload.buffer is not a function, but looking at your contentTokenRoutes.ts, we're using pinata.upload.public.file().

The contract deployment itself is mock (not real), as I explained earlier. The "contract deployed" you're referring to are the mock addresses being generated in your contentTokenRoutes.ts file.

For a real deployment, you need to:

Fix the database connection - Enable your Neon database endpoint
Deploy actual smart contracts to Base Sepolia using your bonding curve contracts
To enable real contract deployment, you would need to integrate your BondingCurveFactory.sol and BondingCurveExchange.sol contracts. Currently, your contentTokenRoutes.ts is creating mock responses instead of deploying real contracts.

The database errors are separate from the contract deployment - they're related to your notification system and other database-dependent features.

Would you like me to help you:

Set up real contract deployment using your bonding curve contracts?
Or help you create a new Neon database connection?
which contract is deployed and which is not? base don the new system

just now
Looking at your codebase, here's the current deployment status of contracts in your new system:

Deployed Contracts: ❌ NONE
Based on the evidence in your codebase:

BondingCurve Contracts (NOT Deployed)
BondingCurveFactory.sol ❌ Not deployed
BondingCurveExchange.sol ❌ Not deployed
ContentCoin.sol ❌ Not deployed
Evidence:

Your contentTokenRoutes.ts is creating mock deployments:

// For now, create a mock token address
// In production, you would deploy the actual bonding curve contract
const tokenAddress = `0x${Date.now().toString(16).padStart(40, '0')}`;
Your [bondingCurve.ts] service exists but contracts aren't deployed

The deploy-contracts.js shows deployment is incomplete

Content Token System Status
✅ Working (Mock):

File upload to IPFS via Pinata
Mock token address generation
Database schema for tracking tokens
Frontend UI for token creation
❌ Missing (Real Deployment):

Actual smart contract deployment to Base Sepolia
Real bonding curve functionality
On-chain token trading
Next Steps for Real Deployment
To deploy the actual contracts, you need to:

Compile and deploy BondingCurveFactory:

cd bonding-curves
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deployFactory.js --network baseSepolia
Update environment variables with real contract addresses

Replace mock logic in contentTokenRoutes.ts with real contract calls

Your bonding curve contracts are ready to deploy but are currently not deployed. The system is running on mock data for development purposes.
