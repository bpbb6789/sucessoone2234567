You're absolutely right - no more mocks or placeholders! Let me remove the fake data from CreatorCoins and build a proper token detail page with real trading functionality like pump.fun and streme.fun.


Edited client/src/pages/CreatorCoins.tsx

Opened client/src/pages/TokenDetail.tsx

Opened client/src/components/BuySell.tsx
Now let me create a proper token detail page with real pump.fun functionality. First, let me check the PumpFun contract ABI to understand the trading functions:


Opened abi/PumpFunAbi.ts

Opened client/src/lib/addresses.ts

Edited client/src/pages/TokenDetail.tsx
Now let me update the CreatorCoins page to properly link to the token detail pages and add trade buttons:

Edited client/src/pages/TokenDetail.tsx

Executed pkill -f "tsx server" && pkill -f "node.*5000" && sleep 2

Restarted Start application
Let me clean up the debugging code and test the application:


Edited client/src/pages/CreatorCoins.tsx
