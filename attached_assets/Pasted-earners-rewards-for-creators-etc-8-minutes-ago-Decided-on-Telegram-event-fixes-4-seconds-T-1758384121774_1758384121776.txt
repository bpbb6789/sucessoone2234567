Decided on Telegram event fixes (4 seconds)
The user is asking me to fix the Telegram events that are not sending anymore. Looking at the attached content, I can see they want Telegram messages for various crypto/coin activities like:

New creator coin created
Trading activity
Top market cap daily/24hrs
Creator earnings/rewards
New channels/creators
Algorithm suggestions
etc.
I need to:

Check the current Telegram bot implementation
See what's wrong with the event sending
Fix the issues so events are sent properly
Make sure all the different event types are covered
Let me first refresh the logs to see what's happening, then examine the Telegram bot code.
