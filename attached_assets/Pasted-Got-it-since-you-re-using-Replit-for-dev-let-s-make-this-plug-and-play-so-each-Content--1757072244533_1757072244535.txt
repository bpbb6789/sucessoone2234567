Got it âœ… â€” since youâ€™re using **Replit** for dev, letâ€™s make this **plug-and-play** so each Content Coin you launch on Zora automatically gets its own bonding curve contract.

---

# ðŸ”¹ Integration Flow: Zora SDK + Bonding Curve

You already have:

* **Zora SDK** â†’ used to deploy new Content Coins (ERC20s) on Base Sepolia.
* Those ERC20s are live and mintable.

We want:

* Every new coin to also have a **BondingCurveExchange contract** deployed.
* The bonding curve should know:

  * The Content Coin address
  * The creatorâ€™s wallet
  * Your admin (platform treasury) wallet

---

# ðŸ”¹ Step 1 â€” BondingCurveFactory.sol

Instead of deploying each exchange manually, use a **factory contract** to spawn a bonding curve contract for each Content Coin.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "./BondingCurveExchange.sol";

contract BondingCurveFactory {
    address public admin;

    // creator â†’ token â†’ curve
    mapping(address => mapping(address => address)) public curves;

    event CurveDeployed(address indexed creator, address indexed token, address curve);

    constructor(address _admin) {
        admin = _admin;
    }

    function deployCurve(address token, address creator) external returns (address) {
        require(curves[creator][token] == address(0), "Curve already exists");

        BondingCurveExchange curve = new BondingCurveExchange(
            token,
            creator,
            admin
        );

        curves[creator][token] = address(curve);

        emit CurveDeployed(creator, token, address(curve));

        return address(curve);
    }
}
```

# ðŸ”¹ Step 2 â€” Updated BondingCurveExchange.sol

(From earlier, the one with **square-root math** and **0.08% fees**. Save this in your Replit project as `BondingCurveExchange.sol`.)

---

# ðŸ”¹ Step 3 â€” Deploying Flow

### In Replit:

1. Add **Hardhat** or **Foundry** for contract deployment.
   (Replit has templates for Solidity + Hardhat).

2. Deploy the **Factory** once:

   ```js
   // scripts/deployFactory.js
   const hre = require("hardhat");

   async function main() {
     const [deployer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

     console.log("Deploying with:", deployer.address);

     const Factory = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("BondingCurveFactory");
     const factory = await Factory.deploy(deployer.address); // admin = your treasury wallet
     await factory.deployed();

     console.log("Factory deployed at:", factory.address);
   }

   main().catch((error) => {
     console.error(error);
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

   Run:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deployFactory.js --network baseSepolia
   ```

3. Each time you launch a new Content Coin with Zora SDK, call the factory:

   ```js
   const factory = await ethers.getContractAt("BondingCurveFactory", FACTORY_ADDRESS);

   const tx = await factory.deployCurve(contentCoinAddress, creatorWallet);
   const receipt = await tx.wait();

   const curveAddress = receipt.events.find(e => e.event === "CurveDeployed").args.curve;
   console.log("Curve deployed at:", curveAddress);
   ```

---

# ðŸ”¹ Step 4 â€” Frontend Integration (React)

When a user views a Content Coin post:

* Fetch the **bonding curve contract** for that token via the factory.
* Use `buy()` / `sell()` methods instead of Uniswap pools.
* Show **fees** (0.05% creator, 0.03% admin) in UI.
* Marketcap will automatically look inflated because of the square-root curve math.

---

âœ… This way:

* **Zora SDK** = creates the token.
* **BondingCurveFactory** = creates the trading market.
* **BondingCurveExchange** = handles trades, fees, reserves.

---

Do you want me to set this up in a **ready-to-run Replit Hardhat template** (with package.json + scripts) so you can deploy straight away?
