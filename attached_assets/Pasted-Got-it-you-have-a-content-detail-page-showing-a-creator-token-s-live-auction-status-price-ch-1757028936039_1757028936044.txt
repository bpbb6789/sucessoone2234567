Got it — you have a **content detail page** showing a creator token’s live auction status, price, chart, trading, comments, holders, and more.

Since you’re moving **away from auctions** and want a **no-auction bonding curve model (like Zora)**, here’s how to **update this page UI and UX** accordingly:

---

# How to update your Content Detail Page for **No-Auction, Instant Trading**

---

### 1. Remove or hide all auction-related UI elements

* **Remove:**

  * Live Auction timer/countdown (e.g., “2h 0m left”)
  * Auction Price display
  * Progress bar showing % sold
  * Bid button & auction bidding inputs

* **Why:**
  There is no auction phase, so this info is irrelevant.

---

### 2. Show the current **token price from the bonding curve pool**

* Fetch the real-time spot price from the Uniswap V4 pool linked to the creator token.
* Display a **single “Current Price”** instead of auction price.

---

### 3. Update Trading UI to allow **instant buy & sell**

* Replace the “Bid” section with:

  * **Buy amount input** (amount of tokens or base currency)
  * **Sell amount input**
  * Show **max balance** for buy and sell (based on user wallet and token holdings)
  * Real-time price estimation based on bonding curve swap simulation
  * Clear “Buy” and “Sell” buttons that trigger Uniswap V4 swaps directly

---

### 4. Show Market Stats from real liquidity data

* Market Cap: calculated as `total supply * current price`
* 24h Volume: fetched from Uniswap V4 or subgraph data
* Creator Earnings: fees collected from swaps (if any)
* Holders count and Activity feed remain the same

---

### 5. Comments & Social Features

* Keep comments, creator info, and activity feed intact
* Add **token-holder perks info** (e.g., “Holding 100+ tokens unlocks exclusive content”)

---

### 6. Advanced Settings / Extra Features (Optional)

* Add a section for **staking or rewards** if applicable
* Voting or polls for token holders
* Direct links to external DEX explorers (Dexscreener, Geckoterminal)

# Technical Notes for Dev

* Use Zora SDK or direct Uniswap V4 pool calls to get:

  * Current spot price
  * Liquidity info
  * Total supply of the token

* Use `swap()` function on Uniswap V4 pool contract for buy/sell transactions

* Update frontend logic to:

  * Disable auction-related hooks
  * Listen to pool events for price and liquidity updates
