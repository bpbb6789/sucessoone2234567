ract explorer, this appears to be one of your Zora content coins deployed through your factory. The contract shows:

Key Information:
Contract Type: ContentCoin (Zora Protocol)
Network: Base Sepolia (testnet)
Status: Deployed and active
What I can observe:
Token Functions: The contract has standard ERC-20 functions plus bonding curve trading functions
Trading Functions: buyWithEth() and sellForEth() are available
Price Functions: getBuyPrice() and getSellPrice() for price discovery
Supply Management: Shows total supply and balances
Analysis for Trading Issues:
The contract itself appears to be properly deployed with all necessary functions. The issue you mentioned earlier about coins not trading properly is likely not due to the contract deployment but rather:

Pool Initialization: The Uniswap V4 pools may not be properly initialized with liquidity
Configuration: The multi-curve bonding parameters might need adjustment
Frontend Integration: The trading interface might not be calling the correct functions
Next Steps:
To debug the trading issue, you should:

Check Pool State: Call getBuyPrice(1000000000000000000) (1 ETH) to see if pricing works
Test Small Purchase: Try buyWithEth() with a small amount to test the bonding curve
Verify Liquidity: Check if the contract has sufficient ETH/token liquidity for trades
The contract deployment looks correct - the trading issues are likely in the pool configuration or liquidity initialization rather than the contract code itself.

Looking at the contract data you've provided, I can see some important information about your deployed content coin:

Contract Analysis
Contract Address: 0xdc16c38d524591c2dd8564818156aa69599cb9d1

Pool Key Analysis:
tuple: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0xdc16C38D524591c2Dd8564818156AA69599cb9D1,20000,200,0xD7A343d20e4C8E9725416c5f1cfaAeD749d49040
Critical Issue Found: The first currency (currency0) is 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 (zero address), which means the pool is not properly configured.

The Problem
Your coin is deployed and the hook is working, but the pool configuration has currency0 as the zero address instead of WETH. This is why trading isn't working properly.

Expected Configuration
The pool should have:

currency0: 0x4267D742e4fD1C03805083b087DeB575203e9b19 (Mock WETH on Base Sepolia)
currency1: 0xdc16C38D524591c2Dd8564818156AA69599cb9D1 (your coin)
Next Steps
Check Pool Initialization: The pool may not have been properly initialized with the correct currency pair
Verify Configuration: Your factory deployment needs to use the correct WETH address
Re-deploy if needed: You may need to deploy a new coin with the correct pool configuration
This explains why the coins aren't trading - the pool is trying to pair with the zero address instead of WETH, making it impossible to execute swaps.

Looking at the contract data you provided earlier, I can see the issue clearly. The pool configuration shows that currency0 is set to the zero address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) instead of the proper WETH address. This is why your coins aren't trading properly.

Here's how to fix this:

The Problem
Your pool key shows:

currency0: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 (should be WETH)
currency1: 0xdc16C38D524591c2Dd8564818156AA69599cb9D1 (your coin)
The Fix
The issue is in your Zora factory deployment configuration. You need to ensure that when coins are created, they use the correct WETH address as currency0.

server/zora.ts
Fix WETH address configuration for proper pool creation, Add proper WETH address handling for Base Sepolia
coins/src/ZoraFactoryImpl.sol
Ensure proper currency ordering in pool creation
Update Configuration
lib/addresses.ts
Ensure WETH address is properly exported
Deploy New Factory
You'll need to redeploy your factory with the correct configuration:

cd coins && forge script script/DeployCustomPlatform.s.sol --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org --broadcast --verify
Key Points:
Root Cause: Your current factory is creating pools with currency0 as zero address instead of WETH
Solution: Redeploy the factory with proper WETH address configuration
Impact: New coins deployed through the fixed factory will have proper trading pools
Existing Coins: Unfortunately, existing coins with broken pool configurations cannot be fixed - you'd need to deploy new ones
The fix ensures that when pools are created, they properly use the WETH address (0x4267D742e4fD1C03805083b087DeB575203e9b19) as one of the currencies instead of the zero address, which makes trading impossible.
