Looking at the token cards you've shown and examining the codebase, I can identify which details are real data and which are mocks/placeholders:

Real Data (from blockchain/database):
Token Name - Real (from tokenData.name)
Token Symbol - Real (from tokenData.symbol)
Description/Bio - Real (from tokenData.bio or tokenData.description)
Creator Address - Real (from tokenData.createdBy)
Contract Address - Real (from tokenData.memeTokenAddress)
Mock/Placeholder Data:
Price - Mock ($0.0000 - not fetched from real price feeds)
Market Cap - Mock ($0K - calculated from mock price)
Volume 24h - Mock ($0K - not tracking real trading volume)
Holders - Mock (0 - not counting real token holders)
Change 24h - Mock (+0.0% - not calculating real price changes)
Time ago - Mock (0m ago - using placeholder timestamps)
Looking at the code in client/src/pages/Tokens.tsx, I can see the issue:

const processedTokens: Token[] = salesData.uniPumpCreatorSaless.items.map((token: any) => ({
  // Real data
  id: token.memeTokenAddress,
  address: token.memeTokenAddress,
  name: token.name || `Token ${token.memeTokenAddress?.slice(0, 8)}`,
  symbol: token.symbol || 'TKN',
  description: token.bio || 'No description available'
  
  // Mock/placeholder data
  price: '0.0000', // Will be fetched separately or calculated
  marketCap: '0', // Will be calculated from price and supply
  volume24h: '0', // Will be fetched from trading data
  holders: 0, // Will be calculated from blockchain data
  change24h: 0,
  createdAt: new Date(), // Could be derived from blockchain creation time
}));
The comments in the code confirm that price, market cap, volume, and holders are placeholders that need to be implemented with real blockchain data fetching.

To get real data, you would need to:

Fetch token prices from DEX pools or price oracles
Calculate market cap from price × total supply
Track trading volume from swap events
Count holders from token transfer events
Calculate price changes over time periods
