lem is that the /api/tokens endpoint in the backend is returning static sample data instead of real token data from the database or blockchain.

Let me check the current token fetching logic and fix it:

server/routes.ts
Now I need to implement the missing token methods in the storage layer:

server/storage.ts
Now I need to add a route to handle token creation when the smart contract transaction is successful:

Now I need to update the CreateToken page to save the token to the database after the blockchain transaction succeeds:

client/src/pages/CreateToken.tsx
The issue with newly created tokens not appearing is that:

The /api/tokens endpoint was returning static sample data instead of real database data
There was no mechanism to save successfully created tokens to the database
The token storage methods weren't implemented in the database storage layer
The changes above fix these issues by:

Making the /api/tokens endpoint fetch real tokens from the database
Adding a /api/tokens POST endpoint to save new tokens
Implementing the missing token methods in the DatabaseStorage class
Adding logic to save tokens to the database after successful blockchain transactions
Now when users create tokens, they will be saved to the database and appear on the tokens page.

can we use https://graphql.org/learn/ for queries ?

Yes, absolutely! You're already using GraphQL in your application. Looking at your codebase, I can see you have:

GraphQL Client Setup: You have Apollo Client configured in lib/apollo-provider.tsx and lib/client.ts pointing to https://unipump-contracts.onrender.com/graphql

GraphQL Queries: You have queries defined in lib/queries.ts:

GetAllSales - to fetch token sales data
GetTokenPriceData - to fetch price data for tokens
GraphQL Indexer: You have a Ponder-based indexer in the unipump-contracts-main/indexer directory that's processing blockchain events and exposing them via GraphQL

The issue you're experiencing with newly created tokens not appearing is likely because:

Database Tables Missing: The console shows errors like "relation 'tokens' does not exist" - your PostgreSQL database needs the proper schema
Data Source Mismatch: Your useGetAllSales hook is currently fetching from /api/tokens (REST endpoint) instead of using the GraphQL endpoint
To fix this and properly use GraphQL as shown in the GraphQL.org documentation you shared, you should:

Switch to GraphQL queries instead of REST API calls
Use the existing Apollo Client setup you already have
Ensure your indexer is properly syncing blockchain data to the GraphQL endpoint
Would you like me to help you:

Fix the database schema issues?
Convert the REST API calls to use GraphQL queries?
Set up proper GraphQL integration following the patterns from graphql.org/learn?
The GraphQL patterns you shared (queries, mutations, fragments, variables) are exactly what you should be using with your existing Apollo Client setup!

I'll help you fix the database schema issues and set up proper GraphQL integration. The main problems are:

Database tables don't exist - The PostgreSQL database doesn't have the required schema
Using REST instead of GraphQL - Your app should use the existing GraphQL setup
Need to run database migrations
Let's fix these step by step:

1. First, let's run the database migrations to create the tables
npx drizzle-kit push
2. Update the GraphQL queries to include token operations
lib/queries.ts
Add token queries and mutations
3. Update the useGetAllSales hook to use GraphQL instead of REST
client/src/hooks/useGetAllSales.tsx
Convert to use GraphQL queries
4. Create a GraphQL hook for token operations
client/src/hooks/useTokens.ts
Create GraphQL hooks for token operations
5. Update the Tokens page to use GraphQL
client/src/pages/Tokens.tsx
Update to use GraphQL hooks Update to use GraphQL hooks Update query usage Update to use GraphQL hooks Update query usage Update data access pattern
6. Update CreateToken page to use GraphQL mutation
client/src/pages/CreateToken.tsx
Add GraphQL mutation import Add GraphQL mutation import Update to use GraphQL mutation
7. Update the Apollo Client setup
lib/apollo-provider.tsx
Add error handling and update config
8. Create a database initialization script
scripts/init-database.ts
Create database initialization script
9. Now let's run the database initialization
npx tsx scripts/init-database.ts
10. Update the main App component to use Apollo Provider
client/src/App.tsx
Wrap with Apollo Provider Wrap with Apollo Provider Add Apollo Provider wrapper
