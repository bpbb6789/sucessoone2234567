Content Size Limits & Guidelines
Smart Limits by Platform:
YouTube: Max 10 minutes for auto-processing, longer videos get queued
TikTok: Usually short, process immediately
Instagram: Medium size, quick processing
Twitter: Usually small files, instant processing
User Communication:
"Importing 15-minute video... This may take 3-5 minutes. You can continue setting up your coin details while we process your content."
The Key Insight
The coin creation process doesn't need to wait for content import to complete. Users can:

Submit import URL
Immediately start filling coin details (name, symbol, description)
By the time they finish the form, import is likely complete
If not, show "Finalizing import..." and deploy when ready
This way, even long imports feel fast because users are productively working on other parts of the coin creation process.

The backend handles the heavy lifting asynchronously while the frontend provides a smooth, non-blocking experience.

i think we should focus on shorts contents for now

20 minutes ago
Perfect! Focusing on shorts content makes this much simpler and more manageable. Short-form content (typically under 60 seconds) solves the performance concerns we discussed:

Why Shorts Content is Ideal
Fast Processing: 15-60 second videos are quick to download and process
Small File Sizes: Usually under 50MB, manageable for IPFS uploads
Popular Platforms: TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, Twitter videos
High Engagement: Short content often has viral potential, perfect for creator coins
Mobile-First: Optimized for mobile viewing, which aligns with crypto/Web3 mobile trends
Implementation Strategy for Shorts
Content Import Focus:
TikTok videos (15-60 seconds)
YouTube Shorts (under 60 seconds)
Instagram Reels (15-90 seconds)
Twitter videos (usually short)
Direct short video uploads
Technical Benefits:
Near-instant processing (2-10 seconds for most shorts)
No background job queues needed - process immediately
Simple progress indicators - basic loading spinner sufficient
Immediate preview - users can see results right away
User Flow:
1. Select "Video" content type
2. Choose: "Upload File" OR "Import Short Video"
3. Paste TikTok/YouTube Shorts/Instagram URL
4. 5-10 second processing â†’ immediate preview
5. Continue with coin creation form
6. Deploy to Zora
This approach gives users the content import functionality they want while keeping the technical complexity minimal and the user experience smooth. No waiting around for long video processing - just quick, viral-ready shorts content that's perfect for tokenization!

Should we proceed with implementing this shorts-focused import feature in the CreateContentCoin form?
