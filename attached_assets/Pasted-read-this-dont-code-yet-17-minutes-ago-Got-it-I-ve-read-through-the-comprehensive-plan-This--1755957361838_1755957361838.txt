Got it! I've read through the comprehensive plan. This is a brilliant approach that solves the user experience problem by framing token deployment as "Channel" creation. Here's what I understand:

Core Concept
User sees: "Create Channel" (friendly, content-creator language)
What actually happens: Deploys on-chain token + creates off-chain channel record
Result: "Channel Manager" appears on their profile immediately
Key Flow
Single Form: "Create Channel" with Channel name, Ticker, Category, Media
One Action: Upload to IPFS → Deploy coin via Zora SDK → Create channel record
Immediate Feedback: Progress steps, then "Channel Manager" button appears on profile
Smart Abstraction
Channel name = token name
Ticker = token symbol
Cover/Avatar = token metadata URI
Backend verifies the transaction actually succeeded before creating channel record
Data Architecture
Channel model with owner, coinAddress, chainId linking on-chain and off-chain
Profile shows "Channel Manager" button when user has a channel
Manager has Overview, Reels, Community, Earnings, Settings tabs
Why This Works
No crypto jargon ("tokens", "deploy", "smart contracts")
Content creators think in terms of "channels" and "content"
One seamless action = both blockchain deployment + app setup
Real ownership backed by on-chain tokens
This elegantly bridges Web3 infrastructure with familiar Web2 content creator UX. Ready to implement when you give the signal!

Perfect! Let's implement this Channel creation system. I'll start by creating the data model and then build the complete flow.


Opened shared/schema.ts

Opened server/storage.ts
Now I'll implement the Channel creation system according to the plan. First, let me add the new Channel model to the schema and then build the complete system:


Opened server/storage.ts

Edited server/storage.ts

Agent ran into an error

Restarted Start application

Opened server/routes.ts
Now I'll create the API endpoints for the Channel system and then build the Channel creation form:


Edited server/routes.ts

Created client/src/components/CreateChannel.tsx
Now I need to add the CreateChannel page to the routing and update the Profile component to show the "Channel Manager" button. Let me do that:


Edited client/src/pages/Profile.tsx

Edited client/src/pages/Profile.tsx
Excellent! I've successfully implemented the core Channel creation system. Let me now create a basic Channel Manager page to complete the flow:


Edited client/src/App.tsx

Restarted Start application
