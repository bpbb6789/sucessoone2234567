Simplified Flow:

Upload media â†’ Set token name/symbol â†’ Deploy â†’ Instant trading
This creates a broader funnel: simple post tokens can be a gateway drug to full channel creation, while serving users who just want to tokenize individual pieces of content.

The Doppler integration would handle the bonding curve mechanics and liquidity bootstrapping, making tokens immediately tradable without requiring initial liquidity provision.

Ready to implement this when you give the go-ahead!

Start: Please note - do not erase the current Channel system. And new model is an additional feature which will require a page called "Create Pad"

Perfect! I'll create the "Create Pad" feature as an **additional system** alongside your existing Channel system. Let me start by setting up the database schema and then building the Create Pad page.

Perfect! Looking at the **Doppler V4 SDK documentation**, I can see we have all the tools needed for full pump.fun functionality. However, there are several key pieces missing to complete the implementation: ## **Missing Backend Infrastructure**

finish the todo;// TODO: Implement Doppler V4 SDK token deployment
// This is where we'll integrate with the Doppler V4 SDK to deploy the actual token, Wallet Integration: Connect with existing wallet system

13 minutes ago

Opened server/storage.ts

Opened drizzle.config.ts
I'll complete the Doppler V4 SDK integration and fix the wallet connection. Let me start by examining the existing wallet system and then implementing the token deployment.


Opened client/src/hooks/useWallet.ts

Opened wagmi/index.ts
Perfect! I can see the wallet system is already well-integrated with wagmi and RainbowKit. Now I'll implement the Doppler V4 SDK integration and fix the wallet connection.

First, let me create the Doppler V4 SDK integration service:


Created server/doppler.ts

Restarted Start application
Now let me install the required dependencies for the Doppler V4 SDK integration and fix the TypeScript errors:


Installed @delvtech/drift, viem

Edited server/routes.ts

Restarted Start application
Now let me update the deployment endpoint with the real Doppler V4 SDK integration and fix the remaining TypeScript errors:


Executed pkill -f "tsx server/index.ts" || true

Restarted Start application
Great! The server is now running. Let me update the CreatePad component to properly integrate with the existing wallet system:

Optimized Agent memory
Let me read the CreatePad component to see its current state:


Opened client/src/pages/CreatePad.tsx
Perfect! The CreatePad component already has excellent wallet integration. Now I need to add the deployment functionality to connect with our new Doppler V4 SDK backend. Let me create a separate deployment hook:


Created client/src/hooks/useDeployPad.ts
Now I'll update the CreatePad component to include automatic deployment after pad creation:
