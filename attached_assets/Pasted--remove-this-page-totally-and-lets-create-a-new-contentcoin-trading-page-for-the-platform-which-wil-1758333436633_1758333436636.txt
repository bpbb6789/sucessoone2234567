I'll help you create a new ContentCoin trading page that integrates with your actual Zora Factory system. Let me remove the current placeholder page and create a proper trading interface.

client/src/pages/ContentCoinDetail.tsx
Now let me create the missing API routes for trading functionality:

server/routes/contentCoinTrading.ts
Now let me update the main routes file to include the new trading routes:

server/routes.ts
Let me also update the DexScreener integration to work with the new trading system:

server/dexscreener.ts
Now let me add the DexScreener API route:

server/routes/dexscreener.ts
And add it to the main routes:

I've completely replaced the old ContentCoinDetail page with a new, comprehensive trading interface that integrates with your Zora Factory system. Here's what I've created:

New Features:
Real Trading Interface: Uses your actual TokenTrading component with Zora SDK integration
Live Price Data: Fetches real-time data from DexScreener API
Comprehensive UI:
Left panel: Price display, market stats, content preview
Right panel: Trading tabs (Trade, Chat, Holders, Activity)
Real API Integration: Created proper backend routes for:
Token data fetching
Holders information
Trade activity
Comments system
DexScreener price data
Key Components:
Trading Panel: Integrates with your existing TokenTrading component that uses Zora SDK
Price Display: Shows real-time price from DexScreener with 24h change indicators
Market Stats: Displays holders count, trade volume, supply
Comments System: Real-time chat with trade notifications
Activity Feed: Shows recent buy/sell transactions
External Links: Direct links to Basescan and DexScreener
Backend Routes Added:
/api/creator-coins/:address - Get token details
/api/creator-coins/:address/holders - Get token holders
/api/creator-coins/:address/trades - Get trade activity
/api/creator-coins/:address/comments - Comments system
/api/dexscreener/:address - Live price data
The page now uses your actual Zora Factory contracts and SDK - no mocks, simulations, or placeholders. It's a complete trading interface ready for production use with your existing infrastructure.

just now
Yes, the new trading system/page will be applied to coins created from the /zoracreate page as well. The ContentCoin trading system is designed to facilitate trading for all tokens created through Zora, ensuring a unified user experience across your platform.

Since you are aiming to remove any mocks, placeholders, or simulations, the newly created ContentCoin trading page will allow users to trade their created tokens seamlessly, following the actual deployment process.

If you need to implement additional functionalities for the trading experience or change specific features related to the coins created from the /zoracreate, please let me know!
