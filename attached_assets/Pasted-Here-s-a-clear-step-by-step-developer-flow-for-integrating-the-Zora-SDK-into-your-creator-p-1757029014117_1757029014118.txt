Here’s a **clear, step-by-step developer flow** for integrating the **Zora SDK** into your creator platform to enable seamless creator token launches — **with bonding curve logic, no auction, and instant trading.**

---

## 🔧 Zora SDK Integration: **Dev Flow for Creator Platforms**

---

### 🔹 1. **Install the Zora SDK**

```bash
npm install @zoralabs/coins
```

> Optional: If you're using WAGMI, you can also use their `createCoinCall()` helper.

---

### 🔹 2. **Set Up Wallet & Network**

Ensure your app is connected to **Base** or another supported chain:

* Chain ID: `8453` for Base
* Factory Address: `0x777777751622c0d3258f214F9DF38E35BF45baF3`

---

### 🔹 3. **Prepare Coin Metadata**

Let the creator input this via a UI form:

```ts
const coinMetadata = {
  name: "My Creator Coin",           // Human-friendly name
  symbol: "MCC",                     // Up to 6 characters
  uri: "ipfs://...",                 // IPFS JSON metadata URL
  payoutRecipient: creatorAddress,  // Where rewards go
};
```

---

### 🔹 4. **Build the Pool Configuration (bonding curve)**

Use Zora’s **default pool config generator** or build manually:

```ts
import { defaultZoraCoinPoolConfig } from "@zoralabs/coins";

const poolConfig = await defaultZoraCoinPoolConfig({
  backingToken: "0x1111111111166b7FE7bd91427724B487980aFc69", // ZORA token address (or ETH)
});
```

> You can later extend this with your own bonding curve config, but this uses the prebuilt Doppler-powered config.

---

### 🔹 5. **Deploy the Creator Coin**

Use the main `createCoin()` function from the SDK:

```ts
import { createCoin } from "@zoralabs/coins";

const tx = await createCoin({
  signer,
  name: coinMetadata.name,
  symbol: coinMetadata.symbol,
  uri: coinMetadata.uri,
  payoutRecipient: coinMetadata.payoutRecipient,
  owners: [creatorAddress],
  platformReferrer: ethers.constants.AddressZero, // optional
  poolConfig,
});
```

> This sends the transaction to the **ZoraFactory** and creates:
>
> * The ERC20 creator token
> * A Uniswap V4 pool with bonding curve/liquidity positions
> * Auto rewards via `ZoraHook`

---

### 🔹 6. **Post-Deployment: Get Token Address**

Use the transaction result or pre-compute with `coinAddress()`:

```ts
import { coinAddress } from "@zoralabs/coins";

const predictedAddress = await coinAddress({
  msgSender: creatorAddress,
  name: coinMetadata.name,
  symbol: coinMetadata.symbol,
  poolConfig,
  platformReferrer: ethers.constants.AddressZero,
  coinSalt: yourSalt,
});
```

---

### 🔹 7. **Display Coin Page (Trade & Hold)**

Now that the coin and pool are live, you can:

* Show token stats (use Uniswap v4 pool info)
* Link to Dexscreener/Geckoterminal
* Let users **buy/sell tokens via Uniswap frontend or your own UI**
* Show fan features: early content, merch discounts, voting, etc.

---

### 🔹 8. **Track Trades & Rewards**

You can listen to the `CreatorCoinCreated` event from the Factory, and track volume via:

* **Uniswap Subgraph**
* **Zora API**
* **Hook events** (if custom logic needed)
