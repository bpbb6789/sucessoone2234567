## Quick Start

This package contains the core smart contracts for the Zora Coins protocol. For end-user guides and detailed explanations, see the documentation link above.

### Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Environment setup**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Build contracts**:

   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

4. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   forge test -vvv
   ```

### Testing

For individual packages:

- `forge test -vvv` - Run Solidity tests with verbose output
- `forge test --watch -vvv` - Run tests in watch mode
- `forge test -vvv --match-test {test_name}` - Run specific test
- `pnpm test` - Run JavaScript/TypeScript tests

### Deployment

The `ZoraFactory` contract is deployed deterministically using a turnkey account. The deployment process uses a helper contract, [DeterministicDeployerAndCaller](../../packages/shared-contracts/src/deployment/DeterministicDeployerAndCaller.sol).

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed.
- Familiarity with [turnkey accounts](https://docs.turnkey.com/) is recommended.

### Setting up environment variables

In the `packages/coins` directory:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Populate the parameters in `.env`

### Deploying the Coins Factory

1. Deploy the `ZoraFactory` contract, you must pass the `--ffi` flag to enable calling an external script to sign the deployment with turnkey:

```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol $(chains {chainName} --deploy) --broadcast --verify --ffi
```

where `{chainName}` is the emdash name of the chain you want to deploy on.

2. Verify the factory contract. Since it is deployed with create2, foundry won't always recognize the deployed contract; verification instructions will be printed out in the logs.
