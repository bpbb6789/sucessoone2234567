REVENUE PROJECTION: 500 COINS CREATED
=====================================

CONSERVATIVE SCENARIO (Low Activity)
------------------------------------
Assumptions:
- Average lifetime volume per coin: 10 ETH
- Total volume across 500 coins: 5,000 ETH
- Trading fee: 0.3% = 15 ETH total fees
- Market rewards: 15 ETH × 66.67% = 10 ETH
- Create referral share: 10 ETH × 15% = 1.5 ETH

REVENUE: 1.5 ETH ($3,750 at $2,500/ETH)

MODERATE SCENARIO (Average Activity)
------------------------------------
Assumptions:
- Average lifetime volume per coin: 100 ETH  
- Total volume across 500 coins: 50,000 ETH
- Trading fee: 0.3% = 150 ETH total fees
- Market rewards: 150 ETH × 66.67% = 100 ETH
- Create referral share: 100 ETH × 15% = 15 ETH

REVENUE: 15 ETH ($37,500 at $2,500/ETH)

HIGH ACTIVITY SCENARIO (Viral Content)
--------------------------------------
Assumptions:
- Average lifetime volume per coin: 1,000 ETH
- Total volume across 500 coins: 500,000 ETH  
- Trading fee: 0.3% = 1,500 ETH total fees
- Market rewards: 1,500 ETH × 66.67% = 1,000 ETH
- Create referral share: 1,000 ETH × 15% = 150 ETH

REVENUE: 150 ETH ($375,000 at $2,500/ETH)

EXPLOSIVE SCENARIO (Multiple Viral Hits)
----------------------------------------
Assumptions:
- Average lifetime volume per coin: 10,000 ETH
- Total volume across 500 coins: 5,000,000 ETH
- Trading fee: 0.3% = 15,000 ETH total fees  
- Market rewards: 15,000 ETH × 66.67% = 10,000 ETH
- Create referral share: 10,000 ETH × 15% = 1,500 ETH

REVENUE: 1,500 ETH ($3,750,000 at $2,500/ETH)

REALISTIC MIXED SCENARIO (500 Coins)
------------------------------------
Portfolio Breakdown:
- 400 coins: Low activity (10 ETH lifetime each) = 4,000 ETH
- 80 coins: Moderate activity (100 ETH lifetime each) = 8,000 ETH
- 15 coins: High activity (1,000 ETH lifetime each) = 15,000 ETH
- 5 coins: Viral hits (10,000 ETH lifetime each) = 50,000 ETH

Total Volume: 77,000 ETH
Total Fees: 77,000 × 0.3% = 231 ETH
Market Rewards: 231 × 66.67% = 154 ETH
Create Referral Revenue: 154 × 15% = 23.1 ETH

REVENUE: 23.1 ETH ($57,750 at $2,500/ETH)

ADDITIONAL REVENUE MULTIPLIERS
==============================

Trade Referral Bonuses (On Top of Create Referrals):
- Extra 15% of market rewards per trade
- Combined: 30% of market rewards = 20% of total trading fees
- Can DOUBLE revenue from scenarios above

TIMELINE PROJECTIONS
====================

Year 2-3: Network Effects
- Earlier coins gain momentum
- Viral content emerges
- Estimated Revenue: 50-200 ETH ($125,000-$500,000)
